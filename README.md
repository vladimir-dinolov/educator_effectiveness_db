# Educator Effectiveness Database

## The "Why"
Much of my data science applications focus on public education. One such application was the creation of a prototype for the Dallas Independent School District (ISD) teacher retention program. Unfortunately, many U.S. school districts have teacher shortages that stem from many issues, the most salient being teacher compensation. In an effort to mitigate this shortage locally, Dallas ISD created the “Teacher Excellence Initiative”. This strategic initiative rewards high-performing teachers with increased compensation up to $100,000. To understand the success of the program, I created a teacher effectiveness database that gathers, stores and allows others to extract information on Dallas ISD educators. 

Data Source: Dallas ISD via Stakeholders

## Outcome 
The Educator Effectiveness Database creates a centralized location for teacher retention data ranging from effectiveness level to school site. Much of Dallas ISD’s data is in spreadsheets or Excel files but cannot be accessed in a database. This database helped inform district trustees and school leaders on the Teacher Excellence Initiative’s success in recruiting and retaining educators. The district most recently reported a 97% teacher retention rate.
