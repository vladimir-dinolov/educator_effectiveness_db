# Educator Effectiveness Database

## The "Why"
Much of my data science applications focus on public education. One such application was the creation of a prototype for the Dallas Independent School District (ISD) teacher retention program. Unfortunately, many U.S. school districts have teacher shortages that stem from many issues, the most salient being teacher compensation. In an effort to mitigate this shortage locally, Dallas ISD created the “Teacher Excellence Initiative”. This strategic initiative rewards high-performing teachers with increased compensation up to $100,000. To understand the success of the program, I created a teacher effectiveness database that gathers, stores and allows others to extract information on Dallas ISD educators. 

## About the Data 
Two datasets were pulled by PASSNYC from the New York Department of Education (NYDOE). The first is a database of thousands of schools across New York City and the second is SHSAT registration and testers. The raw data is comprised of 1,272 rows and 161 columns. Each row is an observation of variables such as state test scores, student demographics, school success indices, and location. This data is public data used to identify students within New York City’s underperforming school districts.

## Outcome 
The Educator Effectiveness Database creates a centralized location for teacher retention data ranging from effectiveness level to school site. Much of Dallas ISD’s data is in spreadsheets or Excel files but cannot be accessed in a database. This database helped inform district trustees and school leaders on the Teacher Excellence Initiative’s success in recruiting and retaining educators. The district most recently reported a 97% teacher retention rate.
